# Chat_pedia
Chat_pedia is an independent project based on the selected topics and their data taken from wikipedia library in python programming.
This a very early stage project which is intended to create a chat web app which works when user prompts the topic and information is produced by the model.
This project is inspired by OpenAI's ChatGPT which gives relevant information regarding the topic. GPT is a MultiModal model which incorporates more then 1 model.
This project contains 1 Deep Learning model and another model is used from language tool python which is used for Grammer Correction.
The Model gives the information capturing some relevant and some irrelevant words and improper sentence formation.
For proper sentence or human like sentence formation following things are required:

**1. Use Large and Diverse Training Data:**
   Train the model on a diverse and extensive dataset that includes various writing styles, genres, and topics to expose the model to a wide range of sentence structures and language nuances.
**2. Fine-tune on High-Quality Data:**
   Fine-tune the model on high-quality, human-curated datasets or domain-specific corpora to imbue the model with specific writing styles or domains, enabling it to generate text more similar to human-authored content.
**3. Implement Attention Mechanisms:**
   Integrate attention mechanisms (e.g., Transformer models) that allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, improving the coherence and contextuality of generated text.
**4. Promote Long-Term Dependencies:**
   Use recurrent architectures like LSTMs or GRUs with appropriate sequence lengths to capture long-term dependencies, ensuring that the model retains context for generating coherent sentences.
**5. Temperature Sampling:**
   Experiment with temperature sampling during text generation, which controls the randomness of the model's predictions. Lower temperatures often lead to more deterministic outputs, while higher temperatures introduce more randomness.
**6. Leverage Beam Search:**
   Apply beam search decoding during text generation to explore multiple likely sequences of words, enabling the model to choose more contextually appropriate and coherent sentence formations.
**7. Post-Processing and Filtering:**
   Apply post-processing techniques or filters to the generated text to correct grammatical errors, improve coherence, and ensure better sentence formations.
**8. Evaluation and Iteration:**
   Continuously evaluate the model's outputs and performance using human judgment or quality metrics, and iteratively improve the model based on the feedback received.
**9. Style Transfer Techniques:**
   Explore style transfer techniques that aim to control specific aspects of generated text, allowing the model to generate content mimicking different writing styles or tones.
**10. Human-in-the-Loop Generation:**
   Incorporate human feedback in the text generation process by allowing users to guide or refine the generated text, providing the model with real-time corrections or adjustments.
